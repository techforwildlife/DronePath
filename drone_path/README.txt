Copy the entire 'drone_path' folder to C:/Users/COMPUTER_NAME/AppData/Roaming/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins - Let the QGIS Application be closed when you do this.
Once the folder is copied, open QGIS 3.x
Open 'Manage and Install Plugins' and tick 'Drone_path'.
Go to Vectors and click on Drone Path --> Draw Grid Lines.
Some default values of Drone and Camera parameters appear which can be changed. Fill the appropriate values and calculate. Output is a csv file with lat lon values and other columns necessary for FlyLitchi.
